A few important notes:

  * install required pydeps first (docs/requirements.txt)
  * run 'nullscan -C' to see which tools are missing
  * nullscan is recommended to be used with BlackArch repository (all tools)
  * read the fucking code and check manpage and '?' flag for options
  * read docs/TODO before requesting for new features etc. :)
