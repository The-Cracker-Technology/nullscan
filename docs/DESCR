A modular framework designed to chain and automate security tests. It parses
target definitions from the command line and runs corresponding modules and
their nullscan-tools afterwards. It can also take hosts and start nmap first in
order to perform a basic portscan and run the modules afterwards. Also, nullscan
can parse a given nmap logfile for open tcp and udp ports and again run the
modules afterwards. All results will be logged in specified directories with a
clean structure and a HTML report can subsequently be generated.

This code is dedicated to my friend Zeljko (R.I.P.), who passed away,
2nd Dec 2012.
